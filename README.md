\f0\fs24 \cf0 NASA ISS FIT IPAD APP\
\
ABOUT THE APP:\
\
Astronauts, Cosmonauts, and Space Cadets (okay, we made the last one up), all face huge technical challenges, are performing scientific experiments on a daily basis, and are working hard to stay fit. One of the key aspects of this is working to understand how microgravity affects their bodies, and how to best keep them healthy. And as part of both space medicine and science, we need to understand what they\'92ve eaten, and how much they\'92ve eaten. The ISS FIT iPad app for NASA will help with this challenge. \
