This set of frameworks and test applications provides a kit of frameworks, tools,
applications and examples for deploying the wildly brilliant PostgreSQL database on 
the Mac OS X and iOS. For more information on PostgreSQL see: http://www.postgresql.org/.

## Documentation

Please see https://github.com/djthorpe/postgresql-kit/wiki for the documentation,
including a [changelog](https://github.com/djthorpe/postgresql-kit/wiki/Changelog) of recent changes.

This software is in alpha development state and as such there are plenty of limitations
and issues. Hoping to get a beta version completed later in 2015. If you know of any 
issues or feature requests, please file an issue and I may be able to help out.
